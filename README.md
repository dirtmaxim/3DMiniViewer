# 3DMiniViewer - simple 3D engine

##### 3D engine written for educational purposes. It is very simple and small. Nevertheless, it can help you to understand how 3D graphic engines work.

This engine allows you to display Wavefront (.obj) format. It has changable source of light, changable camera and you can rotate model live. Also you may change state of perspective distortion (central or parallel projection), show cord render, turn on / off light. There are no excess methods in classes that need to render model. It helps you to explore code and understand it.

Sample of render:
